# FPGAI Project Status

## Current sprint

Sprint 21: full real-pipeline sweep validation toward paper artifacts.

## Latest completed change

Fixed CNN inference HLS code generation.

Completed fixes:
- Tiled Conv HLS helper now supports flat parameter arrays emitted by the parameter generator.
- Stale default type aliases in tiled Conv helper were removed.
- Parameter emitter no longer emits file-scope `BIND_STORAGE` pragmas that Vitis HLS rejects during csynth.
- `configs/sweeps/inference_policy.yml` now uses real precision candidate `fx16_6` instead of stale `fixed`.

Validated:
- `inference_precision_single`: passed.
- `inference_precision`: 4/4 passed.
- `inference_policy`: 4/4 passed.
- `inference_policy_fx16_check`: 1/1 passed with no skipped/unapplied precision mode.

## Truth boundary

Supported after this sprint:
- CNN inference HLS generation through CSim and csynth for the tested sweeps.
- Precision and policy sweeps generate real HLS reports for tested CNN designs.

Still to validate:
- All remaining sweeps across precision, tiling, memory, parallelism, pipeline, training, and hardware knobs.
- Vivado report generation.
- Bitstream generation.
- Real board runtime inference/training timing and accuracy plots.

## Next step

Run full sweep validation in gates:
1. Inspect every sweep config.
2. Run every HLS/benchmark sweep.
3. Collect artifact sensitivity and HLS reports.
4. Run Vivado report/bitstream paths only after HLS sweeps are green.
